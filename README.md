# Word2vec-based AI for Codenames

This is written in Julia, so you need [Julia](https://julialang.org/) to run this script. Tested with Julia 1.7.2.

Run either `julia cn_guesser.jl` (the guessing player), or `julia cn_hinter.jl` (the hinting player). You will also need a word-embedding database, it can be downloaded for example [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit?usp=sharing).

The hints are often weird, somethimes a bit cheating... you will see :-D
